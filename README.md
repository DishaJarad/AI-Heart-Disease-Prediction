Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

Overview
Heart disease is a leading cause of death worldwide, and early detection can significantly improve treatment outcomes. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can predict heart disease based on patient characteristics. We have used AdaBoost and XGBoost algorithms to train models on a dataset containing relevant patient attributes.

Features
- Dataset: Patient information with attributes such as age, chest pain type, maximum heart rate achieved, ST depression, and more.
- Algorithms: AdaBoost and XGBoost used for model training.
- Goal: Accurately predict the presence of heart disease to assist medical professionals in making informed decisions.

Project Objectives
- Develop a machine learning model that can predict heart disease based on patient characteristics.
- Compare the performance of AdaBoost and XGBoost algorithms in predicting heart disease.
- Create a system that can assist medical professionals in making informed decisions.

Technologies Used
- Machine learning algorithms (AdaBoost and XGBoost)
- Dataset containing patient information

Future Scope
- Integration with clinical decision support systems
- Further improvement of model accuracy using additional features or algorithms
